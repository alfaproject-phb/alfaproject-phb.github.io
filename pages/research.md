Hi,

Thank you for your interest in our study! We are interested in the relations between sexual fantasies, attitudes toward sexuality, personality traits, and sexual behavior. In particular, we want to examine the extent to which sexual fantasies influence our sexual behavior over longer periods of time. The study will focus on sexual fantasies with aggressive content.

We will therefore ask you about such fantasies, experiences with sexually assaultive behavior, and experiences of negative treatment during childhood and adolescence in the survey. These topics can be stressful. If you are unwilling or unable to engage with these topics, we advise you against participating in this study. If you notice during the completion of the questionnaire that this is too distressing for you, you can terminate your participation at any time without providing any explanation, by closing the browser window.

To participate in the study, you must be at least 18 years old or have reached the age of majority in the country from which you access and/or use the website. Please answer all questions truthfully. There are no right and wrong answers, we are only interested in your personal opinions and experiences. If you cannot immediately decide on an answer, choose the one that spontaneously seems best to you. The questionnaire takes approximately 40-60 minutes. We recommend to fill in the questionnaire on a computer. Filling in the questionnaire on a smartphone is possible, but not optimal.

If you complete the questionnaire, you can participate in a raffle of vouchers with a total value of 300 € (15 x 20 euros). To participate, you have to provide your email address. The email address will be stored separately from the other data and can not be linked to them. After the raffle, your email address will be deleted. You can find more information about data protection on the next page.

Students of the Psychologische Hochschule Berlin and other universities which allow for the collection of course credit from external research may receive 1,0 hours of course credit for their participation. To do so, you can generate a personal code at the end of the questionnaire, which is stored separately from all other data including your email address. This code is necessary to get the confirmation of the course credit.

If you participate in our study, we would like to question you again in 6 months and one year later about the same topics. After all, this is the only way we can truly understand the long-term relation between the content of sexual fantasies and sexual behavior. For participating in the next two parts of the study, you also receive course credits and get the chance to win vouchers. Therefore, we will ask you to provide your email address at the end of the questionnaire to remind you of participating again 6 months and one year later. Your email address will be stored separately from the rest of your data and will not be used to connect your data across the three measurement points. You will receive more detailed information about the following two parts of the study at the end of the questionnaire.

Thank you for your participation!
